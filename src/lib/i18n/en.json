    "story_title": "The idea",
    "story_p1": "Hotels generate enormous amounts of waste from single-use products that guests buy, use once, and leave behind. At the same time, guests increasingly want responsible options — but not at the expense of convenience.",
    "story_p2": "GreenStay Hub bridges this gap. We place compact hubs in hotel lobbies and common areas, offering high-quality rental products and curated essentials from European manufacturers. Guests get what they need. Hotels get a zero-investment amenity with real sustainability data. Products stay in circulation as long as possible.",
    "story_p3": "When a product reaches end-of-life, it's recycled through appropriate channels. When it's still functional but no longer rental-grade, it enters our donation stream — sold second-hand with 100% of proceeds going to environmental NGOs.",
